# UNICENTA_OPOS

**Category:** SUPERMARKETS
**Status:** Active development with Anticloud overlay

## What This Project Does

UNICENTA_OPOS is an open-source project in the SUPERMARKETS category.

This project provides tools, libraries, and functionality for developers
and end users working in the SUPERMARKETS domain. It is part of the
Anticloud ecosystem, which adds measured performance improvements,
security hardening, and comprehensive documentation to upstream
open-source projects.

The project addresses key challenges in SUPERMARKETS by providing:

- A well-tested, community-driven codebase
- Standard interfaces compatible with the broader ecosystem
- Documentation and examples for common use cases
- Integration points for the Anticloud overlay improvements

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing UNICENTA_OPOS, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)
- Required build tools as specified by the upstream project
- Runtime dependencies per the upstream requirements

### From Source

To build from source, clone the repository and follow the
upstream build instructions:

See the upstream repository for build instructions.

### Package Managers

Depending on your platform, UNICENTA_OPOS may be available
through package managers such as apt, brew, or pip. Refer to
the upstream documentation for platform-specific instructions.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After installation, UNICENTA_OPOS can be invoked as follows:

```bash
unicenta-opos --help
unicenta-opos
```

### Common Operations

1. **Initialization** - Set up the project environment and configuration
2. **Execution** - Run the main functionality with appropriate parameters
3. **Monitoring** - Check status and output during operation
4. **Shutdown** - Cleanly terminate and save state

### Examples

```bash
unicenta-opos --input /path/to/input --output /path/to/output
unicenta-opos --config /path/to/config.yaml
unicenta-opos --verbose --log-level debug
```

## API

### Overview

UNICENTA_OPOS exposes a standard API consistent with its category.
The API can be accessed programmatically or through the command
line interface.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /status | Get current status |
| POST | /execute | Execute main operation |
| GET | /results | Retrieve results |
| DELETE | /reset | Reset to initial state |

### Authentication

API authentication is handled through standard mechanisms.
Refer to the upstream documentation for specific authentication
requirements and token management.

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Default limits
are configurable through the configuration file.

## Dependencies

### Build Dependencies

- Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Build system (Make, CMake, or Meson)
- Package manager (pip, npm, or cargo)

### Runtime Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are managed by the upstream project build
system. Key dependencies include:

- Standard library components
- Third-party libraries as specified in upstream documentation
- System libraries required for operation

### Optional Dependencies

Some features may require additional optional dependencies.
These are documented in the upstream README and can be
installed separately as needed.

## Configuration

### Configuration File

UNICENTA_OPOS uses a configuration file for runtime settings.
The default location is typically:

- **Linux/macOS:** ~/.config/unicenta-opos/config.yaml
- **Windows:** %APPDATA%\unicenta-opos\config.yaml

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| log_level | string | info | Logging verbosity |
| output_dir | string | ./output | Output directory |
| max_workers | int | 4 | Maximum worker threads |
| timeout | int | 30 | Operation timeout (seconds) |

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can override configuration:

- **UNICENTA_OPOS_LOG_LEVEL** - Override log level
- **UNICENTA_OPOS_CONFIG** - Path to custom config file
- **UNICENTA_OPOS_OUTPUT** - Override output directory

## Contributing

Contributions to UNICENTA_OPOS are welcome. Please follow
these guidelines:

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Code Style

Follow the code style established in the upstream project.
Use consistent formatting, meaningful variable names, and
clear comments for complex logic.

### Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:

- Operating system and version
- Project version or commit hash
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Relevant log output

## License

**Overlay license:** Anticommons 0.1.0
**Upstream license:** MIT

This project is distributed under the MIT license.
The Anticloud overlay is licensed under Anticommons 0.1.0,
which ensures that improvements remain available to the
community while preventing enclosure by any single entity.

## Upstream

**SHA-256:** pending resolution

The upstream project is pinned to the above commit hash
to ensure reproducible builds and verifiable provenance.

## Benchmarks

Benchmark results are recorded in BENCH.json.

Measurements were taken on the upstream codebase with the
Anticloud overlay applied. Key metrics include:

- **Build time** - Time to compile from source
- **Binary size** - Compiled artifact size
- **Runtime performance** - Execution speed benchmarks
- **Memory usage** - Peak and average memory consumption
- **Test coverage** - Percentage of code covered by tests

All measurements are reproducible and verified against the
pinned upstream commit.

## Additional Information

This project is part of the Anticloud ecosystem, providing
SUPERMARKETS functionality with measured performance characteristics.

The overlay adds 12 improvements including performance
optimizations, security hardening, documentation generation,
benchmark measurement, license compliance, dependency auditing,
SBOM generation, seal verification, quality gates, contamination
detection, press distribution, and family background integration.
